## Conflicts between requirements and tests
* REQ3.3, REQ3.3.1, REQ3.3.2
  * â€‹Requirement: The user must be asked for a confirmation before creating a new auction.
  * Conflict: The testTDD only works without the confirmation. Therefore the confirmation is disabled.
  To enable confirmation toggle the variable auction > views > CreateAuction > post() > ask_for_confirmation = True
